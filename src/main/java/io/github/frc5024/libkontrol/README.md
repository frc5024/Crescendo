# LibKontrol

LibKontrol (The **Lib**5**K** C**ontrol** Library) is a small [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) library built by [the software team of 2020](https://github.com/frc5024/InfiniteRecharge/graphs/contributors), and formalized into its own package later in 2021 by [Evan Pratten](https://ewpratten.com).

So far, this library has powered the state management of every robot built since 2019.

## A note for future users

From 2022 onwards, the team likes to copy this module around to their new repositories instead of including it as a proper Gradle dependency.

**If you are about to copy-paste this somewhere** please keep the package name the same. This means, keeping the path to this directory as `src/main/java/io/github/frc5024/libkontrol`.
